0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
In this project, the core learnings center on sorting algorithms and the Big O:

Where sorting algorithms are used to arrange a collection of elements in a particular order
Then the Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity, which is how the algorithm's performance scales as the size of the input data increases.
One important consideration when choosing a sorting algorithm is its efficiency, which is often expressed using the Big O notation.
There are many sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, but they all aim to accomplish the same goal.
Sorting algorithms are commonly used in computer science and programming to manage large datasets, search and compare values, and analyze data.
